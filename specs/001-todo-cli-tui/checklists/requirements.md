# Specification Quality Checklist: Terminal-based Todo CLI with TUI

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-02
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items are complete. The specification is ready for the next phase: `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`.

### Validation Summary

The specification successfully:
- Focuses on WHAT users need (task management via terminal UI) rather than HOW to implement it
- Provides clear, testable acceptance scenarios for each user story
- Defines measurable success criteria that are technology-agnostic
- Identifies relevant edge cases without prescribing implementation approaches
- Structures user stories by priority (P1-P3) with clear independence for incremental delivery

No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed as the original requirements were sufficiently detailed and clear.
